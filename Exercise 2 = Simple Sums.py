# Step 1: Declare a variable and initialize it with 8
num1 = 8

# Step 2: Declare a second variable and initialize it with 10
num2 = 10

# Step 3: Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Step 4: Print the value of the sum to the console
print("The sum is:", sum_result)
